Hello! I’m Major General (Ret.) Eric E. Nicanor — a cybersecurity and technology operations executive with 37 years of leadership experience in defense and ICT.

After a distinguished military career, I am now transitioning into civilian cybersecurity, with a strong focus on the CISO track, SOC leadership, and other key information security roles.
