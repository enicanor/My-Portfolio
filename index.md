## 🙌 Why I'm Sharing This

This portfolio is a personal growth record — and a message that it's never too late or too early to enter cybersecurity.

I've built this using mostly **free and affordable resources**, including open-source tools, Coursera, TryHackMe, and structured training from **GUIDEM**. I share this to encourage:

- Veterans and career changers  
- Professionals from non-technical fields  
- Students and new learners starting out


## Stay tuned — I’m actively building.
Open to meaningful conversations in cybersecurity leadership, IT development, and strategic operations.
