## 🌱 Why I’m Sharing This

This portfolio is more than a résumé — it's a living journal of my growth in cybersecurity and a message to others that it's never too late or too early to build your path in this field.

I've developed much of my knowledge through a mix of **free**, **affordable**, and **mission-aligned** resources, including:

- Open-source labs using **Elastic**, **Wazuh**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **Kali Linux**
- Online learning via **Coursera**, **Udemy**, and **TryHackMe**
- Real--world training through **GUIDEM**, whose CDTH and VAPT programs gave me hands-on exposure to cyber defense, threat detection, and SOC practices

I share this openly to encourage:
- **Veterans and professionals** considering a career shift into cybersecurity
- **Career changers** coming from non-technical or leadership backgrounds
- **Young students and early-career learners** who want to start strong with discipline and curiosity — even without expensive tools

If this portfolio inspires just one person to take the next step in their journey, it has already served its purpose.
