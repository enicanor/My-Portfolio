# About Me

Hello! I‚Äôm Philippine Marine Major General Eric E. Nicanor (Retired) ‚Äî a cybersecurity and technology operations executive with 37 years of experience leading national defense programs in military operations, ICT, C4ISR systems, weapons systems, and cybersecurity strategy.

Now fully engaged in the field of cybersecurity, I am building on my operational leadership background to continue my passion on IT/cyber operations, SOC operations, and cyber resilience. This portfolio documents my journey as I bridge executive leadership with hands-on technical capabilities in the evolving landscape of information security.

## üå± Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

This portfolio is more than a r√©sum√© ‚Äî it's a living journal of my growth in cybersecurity and a message to others that it's never too late or too early to build your path in this field.

I've developed much of my knowledge through a mix of **free**, **affordable**, and **mission-aligned** resources, including:

- Open-source labs using **Elastic**, **Wazuh**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **Kali Linux**
- Online learning via **Coursera**, **Udemy**, and **TryHackMe**
- Real--world training through **GUIDEM**, whose CDTH and VAPT programs gave me hands-on exposure to cyber defense, threat detection, and SOC practices

I share this openly to encourage:
- **Veterans and professionals** considering a career shift into cybersecurity
- **Career changers** coming from non-technical or leadership backgrounds
- **Young students and early-career learners** who want to start strong with discipline and curiosity ‚Äî even without expensive tools

If this portfolio inspires just one person to take the next step in their journey, it has already served its purpose.

Open to meaningful conversations in cybersecurity leadership, IT development, and strategic & tactical cyber
